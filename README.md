# Exscientia Code Challenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

To visualise the compounds, I used a popular grid library, AG-Grid, to display the information. Clicking on each row will show the assay results in directly below in a master-detail view setup.

## Libraries
- Node 14.15.1
- NPM 6.14.8
- Angular 11.0.2
- AG-Grid Community 24.1.0
- AG-Grid Enterprise 24.1.0 (required for master detail view functionality)

## Instructions

Angular CLI will be required to start the development server, or to build the project. If not yet installed, it can be installed via NPM using

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Run `npm install` to install the libraries required for the application.

The built artifacts are also stored in the `dist/` folder in this repository to be viewed and interacted with directly.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
